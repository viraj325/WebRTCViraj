# WebRTCViraj
This is a video calling web application using WebRTC and Firebase. To try the application, go to https://cople.app/VirajRTC/index.html?virajRTCID=new.

## Limitations
Currently only optimized for mobile web broswers.
The app relies on public STUN servers and will only work with wifi so testing with 4G/5G network will not work.
